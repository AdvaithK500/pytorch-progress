    "In an ideal world you could do the forward pass and backward pass across all of your data at once.\n",

    "But once you start using really large datasets, unless you've got infinite computing power, it's easier to break them up into batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also gives your model more opportunities to improve.\n",

    "\n",
    "But since this is a value you can set (a **hyperparameter**) you can try all different kinds of values, though generally powers of 2 are used most often (e.g. 32, 64, 128, 256, 512).\n",

    "> **Exercise:** Use the trained `model_2` to make predictions on the test FashionMNIST dataset. Then plot some predictions where the model was wrong alongside what the label of the image should've been. After visualizing these predictions do you think it's more of a modelling error or a data error? As in, could the model do better or are the labels of the data too close to each other (e.g. a \"Shirt\" label is too close to \"T-shirt/top\")?"
